HTML elements with their opening and closing tags in angle brackets make up an HTML document. These elements form the structure of a webpage and describe what to display to the web browser. When it comes to HTML, it's important to know about the purpose of HTML in the web browser. The use of HTML tags and correct syntax, and how HTML elements are used in a web document. 



PS: The HTTP POST method is more secure than the HTTP GET method. When a form is submitted using the Post method, the form data is inserted into the content of the HTTP request instead of appended at the end of the URL as is done with the GET method.
